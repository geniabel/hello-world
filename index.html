        <h2>What is a chess?</h2>

<p>Chess is a board game played between two players.It is sometimes called Western chess or international chess to distinguish it from related games such as xiangqi and shogi.
The current form of the game emerged in Southern Europe during the second half of the 15th century after evolving from chaturanga, a similar but much older game of Indian origin.
Today, chess is one of the world's most popular games, played by millions of people worldwide.
