<h1>Art and humanities</h1>
<p>In the Middle Ages and during the Renaissance, chess was a part of noble culture; it was used to teach war strategy and was dubbed the "King's Game".Gentlemen are "to be meanly seene in the play at Chestes", says the overview at the beginning of Baldassare Castiglione's The Book of the Courtier (1528, English 1561 by Sir Thomas Hoby), but chess should not be a gentleman's main passion.

        <h2>Mathematics</h2>

<p>The game structure and nature of chess are related to several branches of mathematics. Many combinatorical and topological problems connected to chess, such as the knight's tour and the eight queens puzzle, have been known for hundreds of years.


Mathematicians Euler, Legendre, de Moivre, and Vandermonde studied the knight's tour.
The number of legal positions in chess is estimated to be 4x1044,with a game-tree complexity of approximately 10123. The game-tree complexity of chess was first calculated by Claude Shannon as 10120, a number known as the Shannon number.[137] An average position typically has thirty to forty possible moves, but there may be as few as zero (in the case of checkmate or stalemate) or (in a constructed position) as many as 218.
</p>

<h2>Psychology</h2>


<p>There is an extensive scientific literature on chess psychology.Alfred Binet and others showed that knowledge and verbal, rather than visuospatial, ability lies at the core of expertise.[147][148] In his doctoral thesis, Adriaan de Groot showed that chess masters can rapidly perceive the key features of a position.[149] According to de Groot, this perception, made possible by years of practice and study, is more important than the sheer ability to anticipate moves. De Groot showed that chess masters can memorize positions shown for a few seconds almost perfectly. The ability to memorize does not alone account for chess-playing skill, since masters and novices, when faced with random arrangements of chess pieces, had equivalent recall (about six positions in each case). Rather, it is the ability to recognize patterns, which are then memorized, which distinguished the skilled players from the novices. When the positions of the pieces were taken from an actual game, the masters had almost total positional recall.
